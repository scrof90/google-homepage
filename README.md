In this exercise I tried to recreate Google Homepage using HTML and CSS.

In my work I explored the page's source with Chromium Dev Tools and tried to understand the logic behind every entity. The most challenging aspects for me were making a sense of all the CSS classes used on the page.

The search bar and submit buttons are still not functional, I will probably come back to them later when I learn a bit more about JavaScript to practice.

Overall I feel like I have accomplished a faithful-enough reconstruction of the page and pinpointed blindspots in my HTML & CSS knowledge, mainly the usage of Flexbox.
