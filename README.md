In this exercise I tried to recreate Google Homepage using HTML and CSS as a first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com "The Odin Project").

In my work I explored the page's source code with Chromium Dev Tools and tried to understand the logic behind every entity. The most challenging aspects for me were making a sense of all the CSS classes used on the page. I assume it was all done with some sort of framework, because it's not a pretty sight to look at through the dev tools.

The search bar and submit buttons are still not functional, I will probably come back to them later when I learn a bit more about the whole webdev to practice further.

The CSS file is a jumbled mess, I know, but it works. I used the copy-paste method way more than I care to admit.
